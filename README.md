# DeepLearning-HandwrittenDigitRecognition
Deep Learning: Build and Train a CNN for MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition

The goal of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of digits (0-9), each 28x28 pixels in size. Using TensorFlow and Keras, we will create and train a deep learning model to classify these digits accurately. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation to understand CNNs and their application .


Load the MNIST dataset correctly
Normalize the pixel values between 0 and 1 
Build a CNN with Convolutional layers 
Include MaxPooling layers 
Add Dense layers and the correct output layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation 
Use the 'adam' optimizer 
Set the loss function to 'categorical_crossentropy' 
Track accuracy as the metric 
Train the model (3 marks).
Track both training and validation accuracy/loss 
Evaluate the model on test data
Plot accuracy and loss graphs
